# 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Known Issues Registry

This document serves as an active record of known errors, their causes, and the implemented fixes. **Always check this registry before debugging new issues.**

## 🚨 Critical: `markedUnread` Crash (WhatsApp Web Update)

**Error:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'markedUnread')
at window.WWebJS.sendSeen ...
```

**Cause:**
A breaking update in WhatsApp Web (around April 2024) changed the internal DOM structure, causing the `sendSeen` function (which triggers blue ticks) to crash the library.

**Fix (Implemented):**
We must **globally disable** the `sendSeen` feature in all message sending operations.

**Action Required:**
Every time `sendMessage` or `msg.reply` is used, you **MUST** pass the option `{ sendSeen: false }`.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
await client.sendMessage(chatId, 'Hello', { sendSeen: false });
await msg.reply('Hello', null, { sendSeen: false });

// ❌ WRONG (Will Crash)
await client.sendMessage(chatId, 'Hello');
await msg.reply('Hello');
```

## 🔑 Authentication: `LocalAuth` vs `NoAuth`

**Issue:**
Bot requires frequent QR scanning or fails to save session state.

**Solution:**
- Use `LocalAuth` to save session files locally (`.wwebjs_auth`).
- **Cloud Deployment:** Ensure the cloud provider supports persistent storage (Volumes) for the `.wwebjs_auth` folder, or you will need to scan on every restart.

## 🤖 Bot Self-Reply Loop

**Issue:**
Bot replies to itself infinitely (e.g., responding to its own prompts).

**Solution:**
The `index.js` message handler includes specific logic to ignore messages where `msg.fromMe === true`, UNLESS they are specific commands initiated by the Admin.

**Code Reference:**
See `client.on('message_create', ...)` in `index.js`.

## 🔁 Duplicate Bot Responses

**Issue:**
The bot replies 2+ times to a single command (e.g., sending the Menu twice).

**Cause:**
Network latency or library events firing multiple times for the same message ID can trigger the handler repeatedly.

**Fix (Implemented):**
Added a **Message De-duplication Cache** in `index.js`.
1. We store processed `msg.id._serialized` in a `Set`.
2. If an ID exists in the Set, we ignore it.
3. The Set is cleared periodically to save memory.

**Code Reference:**
```javascript
const processedMessages = new Set();
client.on('message_create', async msg => {
    if (processedMessages.has(msg.id._serialized)) return;
    processedMessages.add(msg.id._serialized);
    // ... rest of logic
});
```

## 🧭 Menu Flow & "Stuck" States

**Issue:**
Users were getting multiple responses for one selection, or getting stuck in a menu (e.g., "Rule Selection") with no way out.

**Fix (Implemented):**
1. **Explicit Returns**: Added `return` statements after handling each menu option in `questionHandler.js` to prevent "fall-through" logic (where it would execute option 2 AND the error message).
2. **Loop Prevention**: In `STEPS.RULE_SELECTION`, we now allow the user to select another rule immediately without deleting their session state.
3. **Navigation Commands**: Added support for `0`, `menu`, or `back` to return to the main menu from sub-menus.
4. **Multi-Select**: Users can now type `1,3` to get multiple pieces of info at once.

**Code Reference:**
See `features/questionHandler.js`.

## 🧟 Zombie Chrome Processes

**Issue:**
`Error: The browser is already running...` when trying to restart the bot.

**Cause:**
When the bot script stops (or crashes), the background Chrome/Puppeteer process sometimes doesn't close, locking the session file.

**Fix (Implemented):**
Always run a cleanup command before starting:
`pkill -f "node index.js" || true && pkill -f "chrome" || true`

**Tip:**
If the bot won't start, kill the terminal and run the cleanup command manually.
